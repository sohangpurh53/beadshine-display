## Django Models

Here are the Django models for the BeadsBoutique project:

```python
from django.db import models

class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Product(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='products/')
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    brand = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    rating = models.DecimalField(max_digits=3, decimal_places=2)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Contact(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
    message = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Message from {self.name}"
```

These models represent the core data structure for the BeadsBoutique application:

1. `Category`: Represents product categories (e.g., Beads, Jewelry, Charms).
2. `Product`: Represents individual products with details like title, description, price, etc.
3. `Contact`: Stores contact form submissions from users.
